# Code of Conduct 

One of NextechGS's strengths is our community.  Our contributors and users are pushing the 3D geospatial field to amazing new levels.  We rely on an open, friendly, inclusive environment to facilitate this.  As such, we follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/)'s [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md) to ensure a harassment-free experience in the NextechGS community.  Any unacceptable behavior can be confidentially sent to the core team at [NextechGS](mailto:mark.malewski@gmail.com).

This applies to the main NextechJS repo, forum, twitter, and all channels, including all repos in the [NextechGS](https://github.com/NextechGS) GitHub organization.
